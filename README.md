## User Story

As a marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element 
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

### Description

A HTML marketing landing page that has SEO standards and accessibility standards.
To meet accessibility standards I included an "alt" attribute class to the images.
I increased the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and the properties.
I organized the CSS to follow the same semantic structure as the HTML.
I added an "id" class to the "Search Engine Optimization" in the HTML to create a link that works properly.
Now all application links function correctly.
I replaced some of the "div" to "headers", "footers", "main", "sections", and "h4".
I replaced the "div" on lines 15 and 27 to "nav".
I corrected line 27 in the CSS to match the structure of the HTML, so they both had "nav".
By replacing some of the HTML elements it now follows a logical semantic structure.
