# horizon-refactor

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to build a HTML marketing landing page that met SEO standards and accessibility standards. I wanted to leave the CSS looking cleaner and run smoother.
- I built this project for an HTML marketing landing page because I wanted the client to have an efficient webpage that met SEO standards and accessibility standards so they could have their webpage listed higher on browser searches. I wanted to increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and the properties. I wanted to organize the CSS to follow the same semantic structure as the HTML.
- I learned how to create links in the navbar so they scroll to the appropriate page. I learned how to make a webpage meet SEO standards and accessibility standards. I learned how to make the HTML semantic structure logical. I learned how to condense the CSS into classes.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
- I created a GitHub repository named "horiseon-refactor", made it public, added a MIT liscense, and added a README file.
- I added the unzipped files into the GitHub repository.
- In the terminal command line use git commands to create a directory. Then opened the file in VS code by entering "code ." into the command line.
- In VS code worked on the HTML file, but make sure you are working on a feature branch.
- In the HTML file I created a 'id' and 'class' for the "search-engine-optimization" so that the link in the navbar would scroll to this page.
- I added the 'alt' attribute into the HTML file so that it hit accessibility standards.
- There was a lot of <div> tags in the HTML, so I changed some of them to follow proper HTML semantic structure. I used <header>, <body>, <section>, <nav>, <aside>, <h4>, and <footer> tags.
- After completeing work in HTML I pushed it to my GitHub repository.
- I opened my GitHub repository and merged the pull request.
- I created a new feature branch in the terminal to start working on my CSS. 
- I created to classes in the stlye.css to condense some of the repetitive code, but also making sure it followed the same structure as the HTML.
- When finished with the CSS I pushed it to my GitHub repository.
- I opened my GitHub repository and merged the pull request.
- Lastly I added to my ReadMe file. I merged this into my github repository.
- I deployed my webpage in GitHub making sure it loaded with no errors.
